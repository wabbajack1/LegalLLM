    "question": "hat is the envisioned timeline for the application of Taxonomy-related disclosures set out in the Complementary Delegated Act (CDA)(21)?",
    "answer": " The text discusses amendments to the European Union's (EU) Climate Delegated Act and related accounting directives as a result of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). These changes will affect how companies report and disclose their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data.\n\nKey points from the text include:\n\n1. Companies with securities traded on EU regulated markets must disclose certain ESG key performance indicators (KPIs) at the consolidated group level. This includes net turnover, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operational expenditures (OpEx).\n2. A subsidiary is exempt from disclosing KPIs if it is included in its parent company's consolidated management report and meets additional conditions. However, large undertakings with securities admitted to trading on EU regulated markets are excluded from this exemption.\n3. OpEx concerning research and development (R&D) must be associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities to be included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI. If R&D costs cannot be attributed to Taxonomy-aligned activities, they may not be considered for the calculation of the OpEx KPI.\n4. The text also introduces new concepts such as \"adapted activity\" and \"enabling activity.\" These terms refer to economic activities that contribute substantially to climate change adaptation or enable other economic activities to do so. Examples provided include engineering activities related to climate change adaptation, and a school making itself resilient to climate change while also offering climate-related courses.\n5. Companies must follow accounting standards when recognizing CapEx and OpEx costs for taxonomy alignment purposes. This includes the requirement that prepayments should not be considered as Taxonomy-eligible or aligned until the related elements of CapEx are recognized pursuant to relevant accounting standards.\n6. The text also discusses the allocation of CapEx to multiple projects, specifying that the costs for each project should be separately identified and disclosed.\n7. Other minor points include clarification on the treatment of intangible assets in the OpEx KPI denominator, as well as the requirement that companies provide additional information if their KPIs do not align with EU taxonomy criteria."

    "question": "hat is the envisioned approach for Taxonomy-related reporting in relation to the environmental objectives?",
    "answer": " The European Commission has not yet established criteria for Taxonomy-aligned economic activities related to non-climate environmental objectives, which means only climate objectives (CCM and CCA) can be considered for reporting and disclosure under the Disclosures Delegated Act. Large undertakings and Public-Interest Entities (PIEs) exceeding an average of 500 employees during a financial year are subject to mandatory Taxonomy-alignment reporting starting from 2024. The same phased approach applies to third-country undertakings with securities listed on EU regulated markets due to the amended Accounting Directive (CSRD).\n\nFor engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change, the turnover, CapEx, and OpEx associated with meeting the TSC in Annex II of the Climate Delegated Act can count as Taxonomy-aligned. Activities that meet the criteria for substantial contribution to CCA (points 1-5) and are adapted themselves can qualify as an adapted activity, while those that also enable adaptation can qualify as enabling activities.\n\nCapEx costs should be recognized according to accounting standards, with R&D costs included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI based on their pro-rata contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities if used for both Taxonomy-aligned and non-Taxonomy-aligned activities. All OpEx categories (maintenance and repair, research and development, and any other direct expenditures) should be accounted for in both the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI. Maintenance and repair or other direct costs related to physical and intangible assets are part of the denominator of the OpEx KPI."

The same phased approach applies to third-country undertakings. Voluntary reporting ahead of the timeline is anticipated for entities not yet subject to mandatory reporting but subject to Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\n\nThe text specifies that turnover from climate change adaptation activities, such as on-shore wind farms, must be taxonomy-aligned with respect to Climate Change Mitigation (CCM) and reported under the CCM objective. The same net turnover, CapEx, and OpEx should be used at the consolidated group level for KPIs disclosed at that level.\n\nEngineering activities dedicated to climate change adaptation can count as taxonomy-aligned, and the allocation of CapEx costs must follow recognition requirements. Research and development (R&D) associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities should be included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI.

If R&D is used for both Taxonomy-aligned and non-aligned activities, the costs should be included based on their proportional contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities. The text also clarifies that OpEx categories in the numerator of the OpEx KPI, such as maintenance and repair or direct expenditures, should also be part of the denominator of the KPI for physical and intangible assets."

    "question": "At what point in time does the five to ten year-period of the CapEx plan commence for non-financial undertakings for the purposes of reporting? Does this time period apply both to a plan to expand a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity as well as to upgrade a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity into a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity?",
    "answer": " This text outlines rules for calculating Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) in the context of a sustainable finance framework. The CapEx plan's five to ten-year timeframe starts from approval, and covers expanding Taxonomy-aligned activities as well as upgrading or commencing eligible ones. The costs included in CapEx should follow accounting standards recognition requirements. OpEx for research and development (R&D) is only included if it's associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities; if not, it can't be accounted. R&D costs contributing to Taxonomy-aligned activities should be proportional in the OpEx KPI calculation. OpEx categories like maintenance and repair, and direct expenditures (mentioned in points a to c of Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I), are part of both the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI; they primarily relate to physical assets but can also pertain to intangible assets."

    "question": "What is the beginning of the 18 month-period for the completion of individual measures referred to in point (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I?",
    "answer": " This text discusses the rules for capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) in the context of reporting under the European Union's Taxonomy Regulation. The text emphasizes that CapEx recognition should align with accounting rules, such as IAS 16 for tangible assets and IAS 38 for intangible assets, rather than the contract signing date. Additionally, only costs listed in Annex I, Section 1.1.2, are considered Taxonomy-eligible CapEx costs. Research and development (R&D) OpEx can only be included in the OpEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI) if it's associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. If R&D is used for both Taxonomy-aligned and non-aligned activities, its costs should be allocated based on their pro-rata contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities. All OpEx categories, including maintenance and repair, that appear in the numerator of the OpEx KPI must also be included in the denominator, with some exceptions for intangible asset-related costs."

    "question": "How comprehensive and precise should a CapEx plan be to be counted in the numerator of the CapEx KPI? Would the expansion of an existing Taxonomy-aligned economic activity in the same facility count as CapEx under point (a) or (b) of the first paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I?",
    "answer": " This text discusses the requirements for Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) plans in relation to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities as outlined in Annex I of a document. The CapEx plan should include details on all measures necessary for compliance with the Taxonomy Sustainability Criteria (TSC), including descriptions, costs, and timelines. Only expenditures related to ensuring environmental compliance should be included, and decorative expenses are not considered relevant. OpEx that supports the effective functioning of Taxonomy-aligned assets should also be accounted for in the OpEx plan.\n\nThe text also clarifies how CapEx costs should be allocated to multiple projects and specifies which costs are considered eligible for inclusion in the CapEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The timing of recognizing these costs according to accounting standards is also important. Research and development (R&D) costs can only be included in the OpEx KPI if they're associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, otherwise they may not be accounted for. If R&D costs are used for both Taxonomy-aligned and non-aligned activities, their pro-rata contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities should be considered. The OpEx categories in the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI have different applications: maintenance and repair, and other direct expenditures in the denominator primarily concern physical assets, but they could also relate to intangible assets like software. Therefore, all these costs should be included in the denominator of the OpEx KPI."

    "question": "How should the Taxonomy-aligned value of CapEx be presented on points (a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I?",
    "answer": " The text outlines reporting requirements for Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) related to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. CapEx items under points (a), (b), and (c) in Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I must be presented at an activity level, with relevant values aggregated and clearly identified for each activity. The total CapEx value for a relevant activity is the sum of these items across Taxonomy-aligned activities. OpEx for research and development (R&D) must be associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities to be included in the OpEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI). If R&D costs cannot be directly linked to Taxonomy-aligned activities, they may not be considered in the numerator of the OpEx KPI. Instead, their pro-rata contribution should be included.\n\nThe CapEx costs to be considered for the CapEx KPI are those outlined in Section 1.1.2 of Annex I, following recognition requirements as per related accounting standards. R&D expenses should be included in the OpEx KPI numerator based on their proportionate contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities. The OpEx categories in the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI should align, with maintenance and repair and other direct expenditures related primarily to physical assets but also applicable to intangible assets, making them essential components of both the numerator and denominator."

    "question": "What is the scope of the CapEx and OpEx referred to in points (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 and of Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I, i.e. purchase of Taxonomy-aligned output and individual measures?",
    "answer": " This text refers to the guidelines provided in the reply to question 11 of the Commission Notice regarding Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) under points (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 and Section 1.1.3.2, respectively. The text advises that for this question, references to \"Taxonomy-eligibility\" in the previous answer should be interpreted as \"Taxonomy-alignment.\"\n\nCapital Expenditures can be allocated to multiple projects, but only costs listed in Section 1.1.2 of Annex I are considered for inclusion in the CapEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI). These costs should follow the timing recognition requirements of related accounting standards before being considered Taxonomy-eligible or aligned.\n\nRegarding OpEx, research and development (R&D) costs need to be associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities to be included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI. If R&D is used for both Taxonomy-aligned and non-Taxonomy-aligned activities, its pro-rata contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities should be considered for inclusion. OpEx categories mentioned in Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I that are part of the numerator of the OpEx KPI also need to be accounted for in the denominator.\n\nMaintenance and repair, along with other direct expenditures, constitute the denominator of the OpEx KPI. These costs primarily relate to physical assets but could also apply to intangible assets like right-of-use assets or software. Therefore, all these costs should be included in the denominator of the OpEx KPI."

    "question": "How should CapEx and OpEx integrated in value chains be disclosed in the situation where the reporting undertaking is performing both the upstream and the downstream Taxonomy-eligible economic activity?",
    "answer": " The text discusses the assessment and reporting of Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) in relation to the European Union's Climate Delegated Act. When an upstream activity is defined as standalone, its associated CapEx or OpEx should be evaluated independently from the use of its output in a Taxonomy-aligned downstream activity. For instance, a cement production company can have Taxonomy-aligned CapEx for meeting carbon capture requirements regardless of the taxonomy alignment of the building where the cement is used.\n\nThe text also clarifies that CapEx costs should be allocated to their respective projects based on the timing of recognition as per accounting standards, and only eligible CapEx costs should be considered for Taxonomy alignment. Research and development (R&D) expenses can be included in the OpEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI) if they are related to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. If R&D is used for both taxonomy-aligned and non-aligned activities, only the costs associated with taxonomy-aligned activities should be included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI based on their proportion.\n\nFinally, the text mentions that maintenance and repair, and other direct expenditures, which are part of the denominator of the OpEx KPI, relate primarily to physical assets but could also apply to intangible assets such as right-of-use assets or software. Therefore, all these costs should be included in the denominator of the OpEx KPI."

    "question": "How should CapEx be assessed with regard to Taxonomy-alignment if the asset that the CapEx is financing might be used for various projects?",
    "answer": " This text discusses the importance of accurately reporting Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) related to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities to avoid greenwashing. The text suggests that CapEx should only be allocated to projects carrying out Taxonomy-aligned activities based on verifiable evidence, using a non-financial metric for accurate reporting. OpEx from research and development (R&D) can also be included in the numerator of the OpEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI), but only if it's associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. R&D costs should be pro-rata allocated based on their contribution to Taxonomy-aligned activities. The text also mentions that certain OpEx categories, such as maintenance and repair, should be accounted for in both the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI. The text refers to Annex I for more details on which costs are considered CapEx and OpEx, and how they should be recognized according to accounting standards."

    "answer": " This text discusses the guidelines for calculating Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenditures (OpEx) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in accordance with Annex I's accounting standards. Only costs eligible under CapEx timing recognition rules can be included in CapEx KPI. Research and development (R&D) OpEx should only be added to the OpEx KPI if it is associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. If R&D involves both Taxonomy-aligned and non-aligned activities, the costs should be proportionally allocated to Taxonomy-aligned activities. OpEx categories listed in points (a) to (c) of Annex I's Section 1.1.3.2 should be included in both the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI. Maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures, are part of the denominator of the OpEx KPI and apply primarily to physical assets but can also include intangible assets like right-of-use assets and software."

    "question": "How should research and development be accounted in the numerator of the OpEX KPI where it cannot be linked to specific activities?",
    "answer": " This text outlines the requirements for Operating Expenditures (OpEx) related to research and development (R&D) in calculating the OpEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI) according to Annex I, Section 1.1.3.2 of the Taxonomy. R&D costs must be associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities to be included in the OpEx KPI numerator. If R&D involves both Taxonomy-aligned and non-aligned activities, their costs should be allocated proportionally to the taxonomy-aligned portion. The OpEx categories mentioned in points (a) to (c) of Section 1.1.3.2 that contribute to the OpEx KPI numerator must also be considered for the denominator. Maintenance and repair costs are part of the OpEx KPI denominator, primarily related to physical assets but may also apply to intangible assets such as right-of-use assets or software.

    "question": "How should OpEx categories referred to in points (a) to (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1.1.3.2. of Annex I (OpEx Numerator) be understood and treated in the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI?",
    "answer": " The text suggests that Operating Expense (OpEx) categories mentioned in points (a) to (c) of Section 1.1.3.2 in Annex I, which are included in the numerator of the OpEx Key Performance Indicator (KPI), should also be considered in the denominator. Maintenance and repair costs, as well as other direct expenditures in the denominator, primarily pertain to physical assets. However, these costs can also apply to intangible assets like right-of-use assets and software. Consequently, all such costs should be accounted for in the denominator of the OpEx KPI."

    "answer": " The text discusses the inclusion of maintenance and repair costs, as well as other direct expenditures, in the denominator of Operating Expense (OpEx) Key Performance Indicator (KPI). While these costs mainly pertain to physical assets, they can also apply to intangible assets such as right-of-use assets and software. Therefore, it is recommended that all relevant maintenance and repair or other direct costs be included in the calculation of the OpEx KPI denominator."
